# DATASAL Project

## Main Interest:
The main interest of this project is to combine the benefits of Waze and Booky applications. It shows a list of restaurants nearest to the location of the user and displays its menu and price range for convenience.

## Significance:
1. It could save time for students since they would not have to walk around Taft just to find a restaurant that offers budget-friendly and great-tasting food. 
2. It illustrates the application of Data Structures in real-life situations.
3. It offers new set of choices for students and helps avoid redundancy in picking restaurants. 

## Data Structures Applied:
1. Linked List - Since the choices of restaurants will be sorted according to DLSU Buildings
2. Graph - The application offers options if they want to view the restaurants via list or graph.
3. Trees - Under the DLSU Buildings, the choices (restaurants) are sorted from the nearest to the farthest one (hierarchy).
4. OpenCV - It will be used for the design of the FooBoo application.

## Labor Distribution:
1. Research - All (will be divided among the buildings of DLSU)
2. Design/Layout - Kylie and Hannah
3. Programming - All
